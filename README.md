# Just a few words about this project

The idea was to attempt to create very basic old style CSS/HTML website, with no additional tools.

See the design how it was, not how it is.

Come from the questions: what is the minimum we need to see on the page what we want to see?

How much freedom does the simplicity gives us?

I do understand the issues with current form, and will try to address them soon:
 - responsibility
 - accessibility
 - is the UX understandable? Can a person get the information the want?
